GeekyDic - A Japanese dictionary of words use in Skyrim.

See live: http://emilekroeger.github.io/geekydic/app/

To build this, I parsed the Skyrim dialogue files with Python, extracted sequences of two or more kanji (because they are probably words), and then for each word, picked two example sentences (prefering sentences with simpler vocabulary). I also matched each sentence to the corresponding English sentence.

I also include the JLPT level of the kanji appearing in the word (I didn't check whether the word itself is in JLPT, or even whether it's an actual word that exists), and a link to a search for that word on http://jisho.org.
