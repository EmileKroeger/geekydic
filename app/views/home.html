<p>These were built from various dialogue & subtitle files. This version only contains Kanji words (actually, any sequence of several Kanji in a row, some of which are not words). When possible, the sentences are matched to the corresponsing English, which is usually a decent translation. Words are sorted by frequency.</p>

<p>The JLPT level of the kanji appearing in the word is also shown, and a link to a search for that word on <a href="http://jisho.org">Jisho</a>.</p>
